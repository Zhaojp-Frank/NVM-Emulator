Two feasible solutions:

1. Enable and set PMU on every CPU!

	If we do this, we should let other online_cpus run the set code!
	How to communicate with other cpu? Need to learn.


2. Do what perf_event_open do!

	Still have questions about this system call, but accoding to his
	description, it might be able to do what we want.
